# 8-Slider-Puzzle
The following code solves an 8-slider puzzle with the option of four different algorithms.

To begin, run the code to view the main menu. The main menu consists of 6 options:
1) Create Starting State
2) (Solve the Puzzle using) Breadthfirst Search
3) . . . Depth First Search
4) . . . A* using Misplaced Tiles
5) . . . A* using Manhattan Distance.
6) Exit (-999)

If there is no solution, the program will inform you so.

Otherwise, the solution path will be outputted to the user (with the exception of the depth first search)
  along with the number of moves it took to reach the solution, and the time it took to solve the puzzle.
  
 After a solution is found/not found, the user may choose to select a new starting state, or attempt to solve the puzzle
  using any of the other three solutions.
  
To exit, enter "-999".
